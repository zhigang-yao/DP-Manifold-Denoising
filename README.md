## Requirements

The code was developed and tested under the following environments:

- **MATLAB** (R2021a or later recommended)
- **R** (≥ 4.2.0), with common packages for survival analysis and visualization

Detailed dependency lists and version requirements will be provided
in the final version of this repository.

## Running the Code

At this stage, scripts are organized to reproduce the main experiments
described in the paper:

- Synthetic manifold denoising simulations
- Error scaling with sample size, noise level, and ambient dimension
- Privacy–utility tradeoff analysis

---

## Reproducibility

All experiments use fixed random seeds where applicable.
Simulation parameters (sample size, noise scale, privacy budget, etc.)
are explicitly recorded in the code to facilitate reproducibility.
